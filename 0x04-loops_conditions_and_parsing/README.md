# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

To work efficiently servers, you can create SSH keys for secure, password-free
server access, and use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `#!/bin/bash` for 
cross-system compatibility. Loops like `while`, `until`, and `for` help 
automate repetitive tasks, and conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`, 
and `case`) allow you to control script flow based on different conditions. The
`cut` command is handy for extracting data from files, while file operators 
(`-e`, `-f`, `-d`) check file properties and comparison operators (`-eq`, `!=`,
`-lt`, etc.) handle numeric and string comparisons. Together, these tools 
empower you to create robust, flexible Bash scripts.
