# 0x0E. Web stack debugging #1

Debugging is a crucial skill, often consuming a significant portion of time, and
mastering it requires years of experience with various coding issues and system 
failures. For effective debugging, one should simulate the environment using tools
like Docker, verify assumptions through targeted questions about server status,
configurations, and logs, and gain an overview of the machine's state using commands
like `w`, `top`, and `df`. Additionally, it's essential to check network interfaces
and firewall rules to address connectivity issues, while also ensuring that processes
are running correctly. Debugging can be complex and frustrating, but employing structured
methodologies and techniques can streamline the process, ultimately enhancing a developer's
ability to resolve bugs efficiently.
