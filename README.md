# 0x06. Regular expression 

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for searching, matching, and 
manipulating text based on defined patterns. They use metacharacters (like `.` 
for any character, `*` for zero or more occurrences, and `[]` for character 
sets) and anchors (like `^` for the start of a line and `$` for the end) to 
match specific text patterns. You can also use character classes (`\d` for 
digits, `\w` for word characters) and grouping with `()` for capturing or 
`(?:...)` for non-capturing groups. Lookaheads (`(?=...)`) and lookbehinds 
(`(?<=...)`) allow conditions without including matches in the result, and 
flags (like `i` for case-insensitive) modify regex behavior. Regex is used for
tasks like validating emails, finding hashtags, and extracting dates.
