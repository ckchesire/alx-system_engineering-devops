# 0x14. MySQL : Database Replication

A database is a structured system for storing, managing, and retrieving data
efficiently. It ensures data integrity, supports concurrent access, and enables
seamless querying and updates. To enhance performance and reliability, organizations
often use database replicas—synchronized copies of the primary database—allowing
for high availability, load balancing, disaster recovery, and geographical 
distribution. Replicas help reduce downtime and ensure that users experience minimal
disruptions even in case of failures.

To safeguard critical data, backups must be stored in different physical locations
to protect against disasters like hardware failures, cyberattacks, or natural 
calamities. However, simply creating backups is not enough; regular validation is
essential. Organizations should conduct restoration tests, monitor automated backup
processes, perform disaster recovery drills, and verify retention policies to ensure
data integrity and business continuity. By following these best practices, organizations
can minimize data loss risks and maintain a reliable database infrastructure.
