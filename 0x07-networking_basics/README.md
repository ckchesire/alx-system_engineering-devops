The OSI model is a seven-layer framework used to understand network 
communication, with layers ranging from physical connections (Layer 1) to 
application interfaces (Layer 7). LANs are local networks typically used in 
smaller areas like homes or offices, while WANs connect multiple LANs over 
larger distances, spanning cities or even countries. The Internet is a global 
network where devices communicate via unique IP addresses, with IPv4 and IPv6 
as the two types of IP addresses, and localhost referring to the device's own 
address. Subnets are network segments for efficient routing. TCP and UDP are 
the main protocols for data transfer in the transport layer, with TCP ensuring 
reliability and UDP prioritizing speed. Ports direct data to specific services,
with common ports being 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS). The Ping tool, 
using ICMP, checks if a device is connected to a network.
