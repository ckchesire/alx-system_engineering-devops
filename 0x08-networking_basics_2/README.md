`localhost` (127.0.0.1) refers to the local machine, used for testing and 
rerouting network requests back to itself, while `0.0.0.0` is a wildcard 
address that lets a server listen on all available network interfaces. The 
`/etc/hosts` file is a configuration file mapping hostnames to IP addresses, 
often used for custom hostname resolution, blocking sites, or testing. Active 
network interfaces on a machine can be displayed using commands like `ifconfig`
or `ip a` on Linux/macOS, or `ipconfig` on Windows.
