A web server's main role is to process client requests and serve static or 
dynamic content over HTTP/HTTPS. It uses child processes, created by a parent 
process, to handle multiple requests concurrently, ensuring fault isolation, 
resource efficiency, and security. Key HTTP request methods include GET, POST,
PUT, DELETE, and others for retrieving, submitting, or managing server resources.
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses, acting
as the internet's directory. Common DNS record types include A (maps domain to 
IPv4), CNAME (alias for another domain), TXT (stores text for verification or 
authentication), and MX (specifies mail servers for email delivery).
