# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving issues across the components
of a web application, including the frontend, backend, database, and server. Key
steps include reproducing the issue, using browser developer tools and logs for frontend
problems, testing APIs and analyzing server-side logs for backend issues, optimizing
queries and validating data in the database, and checking server configurations and 
network connectivity for infrastructure-related problems. Tools like Chrome DevTools, 
Postman, MySQL Workbench, and monitoring solutions (e.g., Grafana) aid the process. 
Best practices include leveraging version control, thorough testing, documentation, and
continuous monitoring to ensure efficient issue resolution and maintain system 
reliability.
