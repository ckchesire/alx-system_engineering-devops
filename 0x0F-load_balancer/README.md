# 0x0F-load_balancer

A **load balancer** is a tool that distributes incoming network traffic across 
multiple servers to optimize performance, ensure reliability, and enhance scalability.
It prevents any single server from being overwhelmed, improves resource utilization,
and ensures high availability by rerouting traffic from failed servers to healthy 
ones. Load balancers can operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) for basic routing
or the application layer (Layer 7) for content-aware routing based on data like URLs
or headers. They use various algorithms like round robin, least connections, or 
geographic proximity to manage traffic efficiently. Common types include hardware, 
software, and cloud-based load balancers, all of which are essential for fault tolerance,
reduced latency, and handling traffic spikes in web applications, APIs, gaming servers,
and more.
